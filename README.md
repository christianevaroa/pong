pong
====

Just mucking about with LibGDX really, decided to start off with something easy and make a Pong clone.
Turns out making a Pong clone is easy but making a Pong clone that doesn't suck takes a bit more effort.

Bouncing is broken at the moment because I'm trying different things out (inverting the ball's X/Y velocity on bounce is boring)
